Procurement Cost Optimization ‚Äì Kaggle Dataset
This project demonstrates how procurement data can be analyzed to identify cost optimization opportunities and supplier performance improvements. Using a synthetic Company Purchasing Dataset from Kaggle, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, and a basic price optimization scenario to estimate potential savings.

Note: The dataset used in this project is synthetic. Due to licensing restrictions, the full dataset is not uploaded here. You can download it directly from Kaggle.

üìä Project Workflow
Data Cleaning & Preparation

Checked for missing values

Formatted columns (e.g., currency, dates)

Added calculated fields for savings estimation

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Historical vs Optimized Item Prices

Total Procurement Cost Comparison

Supplier Spend Distribution (Before vs After Optimization)

Optimization Scenario

Simulated cost optimization based on alternative supplier pricing

Estimated item-level and total savings

üîç Key Findings
